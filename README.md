# Target Controllability and Target Observability
Codes for minimum driver/sensor placement and controller/observer design for target control and target estimation in large-scale networks.


# Usage

The following codes are direct implementations of the algorithms for minimum sensor placement and minimum driver placement for target observability and target controllability problems, respectively.

- `find_msp` : Finds the minimum set of sensor nodes required for the system's target observability (a.k.a. functional observability) with respect to a set of target nodes. This is a MATLAB implementation of Algorithm 1 in Ref. [2].

- `find_mdp` : Finds the minimum set of driver nodes required for the system's target controllability (a.k.a. output controllability) with respect to a set of target nodes. This is a MATLAB implementation of Algorithm 3 in Ref. [3]. 



The following codes are design algorithms of static feedback controllers (for target control applications) and functional observers (for target estimation applications).

- `targetcontrol_design` : Designs the static feedback control law u = Kx for target control of z=Fx via partial pole placement.

- `find_F0` : Finds F0 with minimum-order such that Darouach's condition (4) in Ref. [3] is satisfied for a triple (A,C;F0). This is the first step in the design of a functional observer. This is a MATLAB implementation of Algorithm 2 in Ref. [2].

- `functobsv_design` : Designs the functional observer's matrices (N,J,H,D,E) in Eq. (10) of Ref. [2]. The design method is guaranteed to provide a stable functional observer if the triple (A,C,F0) satisfies conditions (3-5) in Ref. [2].



The following examples illustrate numerical results of the algorithms described above for small network systems as well as complex networks like the *C. elegans* neuronal network.

- `main_optimalplacement` : Examples of minimum driver placement for target controllability and minimum sensor placement for target observability applied to a low-dimensional network system and to the *C. elegans* neuronal network. These examples are discussed in Ref. [1].

- `main_targetcontrol` : Example of target control for a target controllable system (A,B;F) and target estimation for a target observable system (C,A;K). This code illustrates the separation principle in the design procedures of static feedback controllers (for target control) and functional observers (for target estimation).




The above codes are dependent on the following functions and datasets:

- `closedloopsys` : Ordinary differential equations for a closed-loop system with functional observer-based feedback.
- `spnull`,`sporth` :  Computes a sparse orthonormal basis for the null space and the range space of a matrix, respectively.
- `maxmatch` : Finds the maximum matching of a bipartite graph.
- `celegans.mat` : Adjacency matrix of the *C. elegans* neuronal network.
